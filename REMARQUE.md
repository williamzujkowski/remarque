# Remarque

**A typography-first design system for editorial, technical, and personal web projects.**

> In fine printing, a *remarque* is a small sketch drawn by the artist in the margin of a proof — a personal mark that distinguishes a limited edition from a mass run. This design system carries the same intent: every project built with Remarque should feel handmade, considered, and distinctly authored.

---

## Philosophy

Remarque exists because most developer sites and project pages look the same. They inherit the visual language of SaaS dashboards, startup landing pages, or component-library defaults. Remarque is the antidote: a system rooted in book typography, editorial design, and the quiet confidence of a well-made publication.

**Core beliefs:**

- Content is the hero. Components, motion, and color exist to support it.
- Typography is the primary visual system, not color, not illustration, not animation.
- Reading comfort always wins over ornamentation.
- Fewer components, used well, beat many components used carelessly.
- A personal site should feel *authored*, not assembled.

---

## Identity

Remarque projects should feel like a modern technical publication — not a generic app dashboard, not a startup landing page, not an admin panel.

**The system is:**
- Typography-forward and editorial
- Calm, precise, and spacious
- Readable and memorable
- Technical without being sterile

**The system is never:**
- Generic SaaS
- Decorative at the expense of reading
- Dense or dashboard-like
- Loud or attention-seeking

---

## Technology Stack

- **CSS framework:** Tailwind CSS
- **Component primitives:** shadcn/ui (when reusable components are needed)
- **Markup:** Semantic HTML
- **Theming:** Light and dark mode support (system preference + manual toggle)
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation, ARIA, contrast compliance by default
- **Tokens:** Centralized CSS custom properties as the single source of truth

---

## Font Roles

Remarque uses a three-font system. Each font has a specific role and should never be used outside that role.

| Role | Primary | Fallback | Usage |
|------|---------|----------|-------|
| **Display** | Newsreader | Georgia, serif | Page titles, hero headings, article titles |
| **Body** | Inter | system-ui, sans-serif | Body text, UI labels, navigation, buttons |
| **Mono** | JetBrains Mono | ui-monospace, monospace | Metadata rows, code blocks, labels, technical accents, timestamps |

**Font rules:**
- Newsreader is used *only* for display text at or above the section heading size. Never for body copy.
- Fraunces may be substituted for Newsreader for display-only use above 2rem where its optical character adds value. It is not interchangeable at smaller sizes.
- Inter is the workhorse. All body text, UI elements, and navigation use Inter.
- JetBrains Mono is reserved for metadata, code, technical labels, and small accents. It is never used for headings or body text.

## Visual Rules

### Do

- Use spacious layouts with generous whitespace
- Use a slightly oversized type scale (body text at 17px minimum)
- Constrain reading widths for prose (max 46rem / ~740px)
- Use quiet, subtle borders over shadows
- Use strong vertical rhythm and consistent spacing
- Keep components visually quiet and subordinate to content
- Use mono text for metadata, timestamps, tags, and technical details

### Do Not

- Use Material Design visual language
- Use loud or decorative gradients
- Spam cards as a layout pattern
- Use over-rounded corners ("friendly SaaS" aesthetic)
- Build dense dashboard-style layouts
- Use animation that draws attention to itself
- Allow full-width prose on large screens
- Use glassmorphism or frosted-glass effects
- Stack decorative UI for its own sake

---

## Content Density Rule

No page should show more than three distinct content sections above the fold. The first screen of any page contains only: title, metadata, and the opening of content. Hero sections with CTAs, feature grids, and social proof are not part of Remarque's vocabulary.

---

## Image Treatment

Remarque is typography-first, but projects include screenshots, architecture diagrams, and terminal captures. These follow strict rules:

- Images sit within the reading column width (max `--content-reading`), never wider
- Images receive a 1px border using `--color-border` — never drop shadows
- Captions use mono text (`--font-mono`) at `--text-meta` size
- Architecture diagrams and terminal captures may extend to `--content-standard` width
- No rounded corners on images beyond `--radius-sm`
- Images are never decorative — every image must serve the content

---

## Motion Rules

Motion in Remarque is nearly invisible. The only permitted motion:

- **Hover states** on interactive elements (links, buttons, nav items): `--motion-fast` (120ms)
- **Theme transitions** (light/dark switch): `--motion-normal` (180ms)
- **Focus ring appearance**: `--motion-fast` (120ms)

**Explicitly prohibited:**
- Scroll-triggered animations
- Entrance/reveal animations
- Staggered load sequences
- Parallax effects
- Any animation on non-interactive elements

---

## Decision Order

When multiple design options are possible, choose in this order:

1. The more **readable** option
2. The more **typographically disciplined** option
3. The **quieter** visual treatment
4. The more **reusable, tokenized** solution
5. The version with **less visual noise**

This order is not a suggestion. It is the tiebreaker for every design decision.

## Page Archetypes

Every page built with Remarque must conform to one of these four archetypes. Agents and implementers should not invent new page structures.

### Essay

Long-form writing. The core content type.

**Always includes:**
- Large serif title (Newsreader, `--text-display` or `--text-title`)
- Mono metadata row (date, reading time, tags)
- Narrow reading column (`--content-reading`)
- Strong prose styling with generous line height
- Low-noise footer navigation (previous/next)

**Optionally includes:**
- Side table of contents on desktop (outside reading column)

**Never includes:**
- Sidebar content within the reading column
- More than one accent color
- Inline images wider than the reading column
- Share buttons or social widgets in the content area

### Project Dossier

A project page. Technical, structured, informative.

**Always includes:**
- Serif title + one-paragraph summary
- Mono metadata block (stack, status, dates, links)
- Architecture or stack section
- Decisions/notes section

**Optionally includes:**
- Changelog or updates section
- Related project links
- Screenshots (within image treatment rules)

**Never includes:**
- Marketing language or CTAs
- Feature comparison grids
- Testimonials

### Notebook

Short-form notes, bookmarks, links, observations. The informal content type.

**Always includes:**
- Compact entries with mono timestamps
- Minimal chrome — content-forward
- Consistent entry structure (even if entries vary in length)

**Optionally includes:**
- Tags or categories (mono text, not pill badges)
- Source links

**Never includes:**
- Card-based layouts
- Masonry grids
- Thumbnail images

### Landing

The homepage or entry point. Sets the tone.

**Always includes:**
- A single clear statement of identity (serif, large)
- Navigation to primary content types
- Generous whitespace — the landing page should breathe

**Optionally includes:**
- Recent entries or updates (3–5 max)
- A brief "about" line

**Never includes:**
- Hero images or banners
- Multiple CTAs
- Feature grids
- Testimonial carousels
- Newsletter signup forms above the fold

---

## Signature Moves

These are the repeatable visual tells that make a Remarque site recognizable:

- Serif hero/page titles (Newsreader at display scale)
- Mono metadata rows beneath titles
- Constrained body width with generous margins
- Subtle `1px` section dividers using `--color-border`
- Quiet, understated footer
- Minimal accent color (one hue, used sparingly)
- Generous top padding before the main heading (`--space-9` or `--space-10`)
- Code and file path motifs rendered in mono at meta size

---

## Acceptance Criteria

An implementation succeeds when:

- The site is comfortable to read for extended periods
- Typography is the most memorable part of the design
- The design feels cohesive across all pages
- Technical details feel native to the aesthetic, not bolted on
- The result is distinctive without being gimmicky
- The mobile version is roomy and readable — not a compressed desktop layout
- A reader could identify it as a Remarque site without being told

## What Remarque Is Named For

In fine art printmaking, a *remarque* is a small original drawing made by the artist in the margin of a print. Found only in limited proof editions, the remarque is the mark that says: this was made by a specific person, with intention, by hand.

This system carries that idea forward. Every site built with Remarque should feel like it was made by someone who cares about how words sit on a page.
